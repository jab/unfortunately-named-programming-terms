Unfortunately-Named Programming Terms
=====================================

Because programming would be hard enough if we had good names for things.
I mean seriously.
For an activity that requires such relentless, fastidious precision of its practitioners,
it's miraculous we can even communicate at all.

If you've ever tried teaching programming to beginners, maybe you've noticed.
Or maybe this is the first time you're deliberately considering
how overloaded our terms of art are,
and are maybe surprised by what you find.

Either way, welcome!

Hope you find this interesting,
and please feel welcome to contribute.
